# ‚öôÔ∏è What does Gear do?

|||
|:--:|:--:|
|<img src="images/rust.png" height="64"><br>Gear provides the easiest and most cost-effective way to run WebAssembly programs (smart-contracts) compiled from many popular languages, such as Rust, C/C++ and more.|<img src="images/api.png" height="64"><br>Gear ensures very minimal, intuitive, and sufficient API for running both newly written and existing programs on multiple networks without the need to rewrite them.|
|<img src="images/state.png" height="64"><br>Smart Contracts are stored in the blockchain‚Äôs state and are invoked preserving their state upon request.|<img src="images/apps.png" height="64"><br>GEAR enables a seamless transition to Web3, alows running dApps, microservices, middleware, open APIs.|

### :fire: Key features

 - Programs run in WASM WM (near-native code execution speed)—Å—Ä—â–ª—â 
 - **Unique** :crown: : Parallelizable architecture (even greater speed)
 - **Unique** :crown: : Actor model for message-passing communications - secure, effective, clear
 - dApp in minutes using GEAR libraries
 - Based on Substrate

### :bulb: Main capabilities

Gear allows anyone to create and run any custom-logic dApp and is a go-to solution for the following types of applications:
  - A **self-contained blockchain** network (and very fast).
  - A standalone instance running microservices, middleware, open API and more
  - Being a **Polkadot parachain**, establish cross-chain communications between other blockchains. Allow anyone to run a dApp in the Polkadot network in a very **cost-less** manner.
  - Join Substrate-supported blockchains in any other platform outside Polkadot.
  
  # üßê Why?

The blockchain technology launched a rapid transition from centralized, server-based internet (Web2) to decentralized, distributed one (Web3). 

Web3 introduces a new type of decentralized applications (dApps) that enable the existence of DeFi, DEX, Decentralized marketplaces, NFTs, Creators and Social Tokens.

Smart Contract is an equivalent of a microservice which is stored on the blockchain network and is the essential building block of a decentralized application.

Modern blockchains solve many issues of the older blockchain networks, such as:
 - Lack of scalability, low transaction speed, high transaction costs
 - Domain-specific development language (high barrier to entry)
 - Complex and inefficient native consensus protocols
 - Absence of intercommunication tools

But still have room for improvements due to:
 - Fixated, rigid native consensus protocols
 - Lack of interoperability with other networks

To resolve the interoperability issue, Parity technologies focused on creating a technology that connects every other blockchain: 
  - Polkadot - a blockchain of blockchains. Provides a ‚Äúrelay chain‚Äù (the primary blockchain) that allows ‚Äúparachains‚Äù (functional blockchains) to be deployed on top of it. All parachains are interconnected, creating a massive network of multifunctional blockchain services.
  - Substrate - a modular framework that allows to create custom-built blockchains with consensus mechanism, core functionality and security out of the box.

Building a blockchain with Substrate allows it to be deployed on any compatible relay chain such as Polkadot and Kusama
Substrate serves as a layer of communication between the relay chain and the parachain

# <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://seeklogo.com/images/F/For_Dummies-logo-270963AFD1-seeklogo.com.png" width="40" alt="get-start"> Getting Started

1. To start familiarity with Gear, download and run Gear node connected to the testnet.

2. Build your smart-contract into WASM 

2. Deploy and test smart contract, check how it is going. A comprehensive amount of smart contract examples is available for your convenience and faster onboarding.

## <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/256/0*85Brxv3Qe4ps_A6C" width="40" alt="run-node"> Run Gear Node

....Some node Badge...?

1. Download nightly build of Gear node:

    - **Windows x64**: [gear-nightly-windows-x86_64.zip](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-windows-x86_64.zip)
    - **macOS M1**: [gear-nightly-macos-m1.tar.gz](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-m1.tar.gz)
    - **macOS Intel x64**: [gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz)
    - **Linux x64**: [gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz)

2. Run Gear node without special arguments to get a node connected to the testnet:

    ```bash
    gear-node
    ```

3. Get more info about usage details, flags, avilable options and subcommands:

    ```bash
    gear-node --help
    ```

Gear node can run in a single Dev Net mode or you can create a Multi-Node local testnet or make your own build of Gear node.

Refer to the [Gear Node README](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/node) for details and some examples.

Prepare your program
1. Choose an example program from [examples](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/examples) or use your own program
2. Follow the [instruction](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/blob/master/examples/README.md) to build the Rust to WebAssembly program
    
### Upload program from UI
